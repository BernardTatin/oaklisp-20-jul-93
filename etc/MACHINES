This is information about various ports of Oaklisp, and their status.

Solaris 11 x86
    Work in progress

Sun3
	Works fine.

VAX
	Works fine.

Convex
	Works fine.

Sun4 (SPARC)
	Works fine.

DEC PMAX
	Works fine.

IBM/RT:
	High C compiler (hc) works fine, pcc (cc) has some problems
	with the generated assembly having bad offsets which freaks
	the assembler into warning messages, and into rounding the
	offsets the wrong way.  I have a fixed assembler available,
	it's just a few lines of bad code in IBM's source.

IBM 6000 series (their superscaler workstations)
	Works fine.

Macintosh:
	Works fine.
	(Changes from Bruce.Horn@cs.cmu.edu merged and tested)

Amiga:
	Works fine.
	(Changes from Eugen Bacic <bacic@ncs.dnd.ca> 4-Oct-90 merged:
	To compile it on an Amiga with Lattice C:
			lc -dAMIGA -dFAST -L -m0t -b #?.c
	This will define FAST and AMIGA, tell the compiler to Link
	after compiling all the various parts, compile the code for a
	68000 and time optimizations using 32bit addressing.  Doing
	full optimizations blows away Lattice C 5.04 so I didn't use
	it.  The only slow part is loading (about 10 seconds on an
	'030 Amiga and 1 minute on a stock 68000 Amiga).  Once the
	system is up it is fairly responsive.  Also, you need from
	just over a megabyte (for Scheme) to 3 megabytes (for Liszt).
	But, everything loads and works.  I mostly use Scheme so
	that's been tested more than the others.

	I tried Manx C but couldn't quite get it to compile)

80x86, MSDOS
	Works fine w/ 32-bit pointers and large memory model.  Whatever
	that means.

Ridge PYRAMID
	Works fine.  "Loves all those registers."

IBM 360/370 machines
	Works fine, "even with 24-bit pointers."
